# Icons Directory

This directory contains the extension icons. For a production extension, you should replace these placeholder files with actual PNG icons:

- icon16.png: 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- icon48.png: 48x48 pixels (extension management page)  
- icon128.png: 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

You can create these using any image editor. The icons should represent a bookmark or folder symbol for the Bookmark Organizer Pro extension.

For development, the extension will work without these files, but Chrome will show default icons.
